                        Topographic maps are typically used to showcase interval differences in elevation in a clean yet effective manner. Using the same logic, 
                        combined with classic K-Means clustering techniques, we can adapt topography to football. This project also explores the difficulties 
                        (and triumphs) behind scraping data directly from images.</p>

                Graduating from the University of Maryland in December of 2022, I received my 
                degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Data Science and a minor in 
                Geographic Information Systems. Driven by my passion for statistics, I take pride 
                in taking on difficult challenges in my fields of interest, focusing on unique 
                analytical solutions. Through the use of facts, charts, figures, and outside the 
                box thinking, I believe that any challenge can be solved.
                <br><br>
                Born and raised in Pittsburgh, I am a die-hard fan of all things black and gold. 
                I enjoy spending my free time with my two dogs, watching football, chatting with 
                friends, or playing ultimate frisbee. I also love watching movies and TV, am a 
                big fan of Marvel, and have had a passion for geography since I was little. As 
                this site continues to grow, you will see more and more projects from me covering 
                my topics of interest.
