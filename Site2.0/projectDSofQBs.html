                    <strong>Part One:</strong> Quarterback is the most important position in sports. 
                    Despite this, it remains a notoriously difficult position to scout. Instead of scouting 
                    quarterbacks directly, explore using the easier-to-scout wide receiver position to evaluate 
                    our future signal callers.<br><br>
                    
                    <strong>Part Two:</strong> At what draft pick have teams had the most success
                    drafting quarterbacks? When should a team trade up for a quarterback? Is it 
                    really worth it to move up to pick 32 and secure that fifth year option on a
                    quarterback with a mid-round grade? This section explores how quarterback value 
                    aligns with draft pick value.<br><br>

                    <strong>Part Three:</strong> Teams often hold on to starting quarterbacks for 
                    far too long. This leads to far too many decade-long Super Bowl appearance droughts. 
                    Ultimately, many teams and quarterbacks alike would be better off with earlier divorces. 
                    That being said, when exactly should you move on from your quarterback?<br><br>

                    <strong>Part Four:</strong> It takes an incredibly rare quarterback to be able to win
                    with limited surrounding talent. By taking a look at the draft strategies followed by 
                    Super Bowl winning teams, we can learn how to put young quarterbacks into friendlier 
                    situations. Ultimately, altering one's draft strategy may just turn a talented
                    quarterback into a Super Bowl quarterback.<br><br>

                    <strong>Part Five:</strong> Not all stats warrant a full section of discussion.
                    This section explores quick and easy data analysis on topics such as player value vs 
                    pick drafted, QB value vs height, QB value vs 40-time, and so much more.<br><br>
